# PDF Documents

Place the following PDF files in this `public` folder:

1. **privacy-policy.pdf** - Privacy Policy document
2. **terms-of-service.pdf** - Terms of Service document  
3. **cookie-policy.pdf** - Cookie Policy document

## Document Viewer

The PDFs are viewed through a secure document viewer at:
- `/document-viewer/privacy-policy`
- `/document-viewer/terms-of-service`
- `/document-viewer/cookie-policy`

The document viewer:
- Opens in a new tab
- Prevents downloading (right-click disabled, keyboard shortcuts disabled)
- Prevents text selection
- Provides navigation controls (Previous/Next, Zoom)
- Displays documents in a secure, read-only format

**Note:** While we implement multiple download restrictions, determined users with technical knowledge may still find ways to access the PDF files. This is a limitation of web-based document viewing.
